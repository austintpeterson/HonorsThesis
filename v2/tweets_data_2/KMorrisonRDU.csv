1075055093526028295,"@KapptainMurica @BarrettSallee Okay Kapptain. You win. UCF is the best school in CFB and all the other teams and media are being mean.

1075047430956171264,"@KapptainMurica @BarrettSallee And I get your point, who cares what’s going on around the field, we can win in an empty stadium. But that’s not CFB. The pageantry matters. Part of why G5 isn’t taken seriously."

1075046834027016193,"@KapptainMurica @BarrettSallee UCF is one of the largest (did it pass Michigan for largest?) schools in the nation and in a major metro. Spectrum holds 45k people. If the on field product is as good as claimed, there should never be an empty seat."
