1074405218610221056,@AndyJLavelle When he twisted it. It didn’t look like it went all the way.  I’m hoping :/
1074400252231380993,@shaepeppler Nice sign to see Mitchell run a 4th quarter touchdown drive in a tight game too. !
1074399973637263360,@MissMahlia And Mitchell orchestrating a 4th quarter touchdown drive in a tight game.  Something we really haven’t seen yet this year.  Good sign
1074397875340238855,@TeoRey1221 Agree.   Good ol fashioned play calling here on out should get it done. The way the. Bears d looked on the last packer possession
