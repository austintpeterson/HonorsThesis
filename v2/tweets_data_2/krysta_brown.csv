1074748667553185792,@crissydanielle_ That is sick
1074737733011206145,@xIcecream_123x @crissydanielle_ She may have done all that and that‚Äôs of course fucked up if she did and beyond wrong but domo allowed it she stayed for a long time so it falls on her too .
1074737488177041408,@xIcecream_123x @crissydanielle_ She also is not bringing as much of their business to social media as domo is and I‚Äôm not saying im against domo but domo has certainly said more over social media than crissy. We only know what they post and just because crissy chooses not to say much doesn‚Äôt mean anything z
1074728953426911233,@jb_lgbt @xIcecream_123x @crissydanielle_ THANK YOU !!! Like how can we really bash one if we don‚Äôt know them personally ? If we haven‚Äôt been there with them in person through the relationship they had . No matter what somewhere they both had love you don‚Äôt stay for years with out some kind of love .
1074728155452194817,@jb_lgbt @xIcecream_123x @crissydanielle_ It‚Äôs childish and pretty sad . I‚Äôm a mom and if my child‚Äôs father and I weren‚Äôt together still I would never bring anything to social media . It‚Äôs a lot deeper than everything domo is saying . They both have faults they both need to see that . But we don‚Äôt know them to say much
1074723162070360066,@xIcecream_123x @crissydanielle_ That means nothing not any of us know crissy or domo personally and idc what they say about each other no one really knows what happened in the relationship . Everyone who can down talk someone they don‚Äôt know at all is pretty low .
1074688388962443265,"@crissydanielle_ Ignore the hate , stay positive ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1074685487791697920,@crissydanielle_ No one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes learning from them and becoming a better person because of them is true growth. I hope everything gets better for you . Stay up beautiful
