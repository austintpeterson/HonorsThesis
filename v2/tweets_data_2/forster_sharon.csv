976142647009083399,@stutwopoo @BBCNWT @manairport @LPL_Airport Yes ive been through security in 2 hours before and there was only 3 machines working. The announcers were hysterically shouting for certain flights to go to front. It was carnage. Now I’m no expert but they can’t say they didn’t know as they schedule the flights!
