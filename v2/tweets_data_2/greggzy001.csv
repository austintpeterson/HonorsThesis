1072935283593764865,Quick commute on the #awpr today. Saved 25 minutes EACH WAY! Just imagine how much time would have been saved if the AWPR was built 10 years ago! For me it would have saved 2167 hours or 90 full days of travel time! Not to mention the CO2 emissions! üëçüèªüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
