1070680616344145922,"@gtbank @CPCNig @cenbank You sent me a mail saying I should visit the branch to reconfirm my request, was it I who placed a restriction on my account? Was I ever informed?  No!  You have to fix this the way you created. This is highly unethical and unprofessional."
1070609749958426624,@Zullyabu1 @NGRPresident @ProfOsinbajo I'm just patiently waiting
1070609028273688576,@StanbicIBTC @cenbank @CPCNig I've been contacted by a customer care representative and I'm standing by.
1070584607710609408,@gtbank Why was a restriction placed on my account and who gave such orders? @CPCNig @cenbank @gtbank
1070580427285544960,@StanbicIBTC Why has my money not been reversed into my account after a failed transaction? I had lodged a complain since 26/11/18 and I'm yet to get a reversal.  I may be forced to take legal action if this issue is not resolved in 48hours.@cenbank @CPCNig @StanbicIBTC
