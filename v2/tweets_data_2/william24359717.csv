1073728454787518472,@FEAR_BabyB @Treyarch @CallofDuty I was just wondering the same thing. My game isn’t even showing that it’s 2xp.

1072916570316394496,@CallofDuty So anyone else suddenly getting kicked from lobbies after every game?

1064946935977652224,@charlieINTEL Hopefully it fixes blue screen
1064680550101917701,"@Treyarch I’d just like to be able to play my first game after turning it back on without it ending in a blue screen. Turn the game on, first game blue screen, seems ok after that. Next time I get on, first game same thing. And it’s not just once a day. It’s every time I turn the game on."
1064571443638353922,@cod247tweets @charlieINTEL The only issues I’ve been having is the damn blue screen.
