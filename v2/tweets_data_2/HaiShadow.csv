1074406110436700160,"@realAdr1an @brianchee26 @Timcast Makes sense. With the federal workers not being allowed to interact in the first place out of fear, I'm sure that they will have to do a super thorough background check on volunteers. Imagine the PR they will go through if they mess up and a volunteer messes with a kid."
1074371796391084032,@ParanoidFactoid @Timcast That's interesting. In my experience the opposite is true. Most prefer to run and hide to avoid the chance of being deported
1074368873070243840,@brianchee26 @Timcast It would be nice for the kids to get someone trained to handle them instead of feds that are instructed not to touch or interact. We have so many people that speak Spanish I'm sure there are teachers available for this. There is no shortage of people willing to try to help

1073410530419924992,"@shoe0nhead @DaisyCousens They're insults that have been so overused they don't even offend anymore. Like your momma jokes and ""I know what you are but what am I?"""
1073366109406093312,"@LordStreetGuru @Swagkage That works for half of the guys out there. The other half have amazing air game. Chrom is stupid good and inkling/pichu are way too low to the ground to get a decent aerial attack off. He gets too easily punished when he lands too. Once you get around that, you are golden"
1073363980368994304,@LordStreetGuru @Swagkage He would probably get destroyed by anyone that is fast and excels at close range until he gets the hang of Snake. That's a rough grind to get to too
1073275929768681473,"@LilithLovett They're doing it because they are doing. So many of them are getting laid off that the only way they can stay relevant is to take swings at others that just keep growing in popularity. But they can slander all they want, they are still laying off people and they will die off."
