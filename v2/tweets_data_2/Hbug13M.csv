1074865629461590017,"@charliekirk11 And I'm much more worried about our national sovereignty. We need to stand up and make our voices heard! Trump will not always be our president, we need to WAKE UP. Merkel says UN majority is binding to ALL nations. So, uh...not really nations then, eh? https://t.co/OlVyGtzWLJ"
1074863056805490688,@UniteAmerica1st @YouTube Please talk about Merkel declaring that the UN majority support of the Global Migration Pact means it will apply to ALL countries! This is a major power grab! We can NOT let the UN take away sovereignty from USA and its allies. Many countries oppose this. Voice for the people!
1074849556037169155,@TheRebelTV @jackbuckby The USA needs to rally round the UK. This is destruction of representation. No Brexit = No voice of the people. Nationalism is not racism! It's patriotism! We need Farage and Moggs front and center.
1074848707357491200,@realDonaldTrump We need to stand by our family farmers most of all. There is a plan to get land away from small family farms and condense food production to a few big names. (Yummy Monsanto chem veg!) Protect private property rights! NO AGENDA 2030! Climate change is a Trojan horse.

1074845533519306752,"@realDonaldTrump @Patrici15767099 Mr. President, PLEASE get us out of the UN! Merkel thinks the majority rule and the Global Migration Pact will apply to EVERY COUNTRY regardless. If we have no national sovereignty walls mean nothing. Please, Mr. President, stand by Hungary and Poland. Nationalism IS patriotism!"
1074844186841468928,@charliekirk11 A physical wall means nothing if the UN decides we have no border. We need to make our voices heard! The UN will NOT take away the sovereignty of our country or our Eastern European friends. Germany thinks it can run the world again! Did WWII teach us nothing???

-Destroy property
-Scream at random people
-Make rhymes about killing cops
-Ask for a bunch of free stuff

Uh, yeah...TOTALLY makes sense."
