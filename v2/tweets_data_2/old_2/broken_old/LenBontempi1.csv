Didnt even bother to review the legacy of delayed and cancelled flights - too busy not servicing aircraft I guess.  United ""Club"" internet has dropped 4 times this hour"

1074825096466980869,"@united I know what is going on, flight is delayed somewhere else and late coming in.  The Larger issue is WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME - and I mean ALL THE TIME"
1074824214761406470,@united another flight another delay.  5 in a row over the last few weeks.  No Airline is as poorly run or offers as poor service as United.  New Year's resolution is to find a new airline.  Enough is Enough
