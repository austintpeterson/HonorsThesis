1074877098630754304,@MaureenShaw @Alyssa_Milano Trump has done everything humanly possible to forestall the next recession. There is something called the business cycle and right now we are in the longest bull market in US history. The economy needs to go into recession to clear all the malinvestment of the past decade.
1074836084692004864,@Comey @Alyssa_Milano Jim Comey is at best a sleazy operator sending FBI agents to try to trick General Flynn into lying to the FBI and perjuring himself. At worst he is a criminal leaker and thief of government work product.

1074833938798002176,@Comey @Alyssa_Milano Trump is correct as usual! It's called attorney client privilege and it is sacrosanct in our judicial system. The FBI would NEVER have raided Cohen's office if he had not been Trump's lawyer.
1074741086134910976,@RodneyJames138 @RealJamesWoods I'm going to laugh my a** off when best buds Muller and Comey are sharing a jail cell.
1074740253951451138,@RodneyJames138 @RealJamesWoods Robert Muller is a criminal and a dunce. Trump is laughing at him. Muller will soon see the inside of a jail cell.
1074690318782660608,@HowardKurtz If there was even a slight chance that the MSM non-journalists would have a truce with POTUS then I would agree. But these lunatic propagandists will NEVER let their bias rest even for a nanosecond. Trump was right to cancel the event - MAGA!
