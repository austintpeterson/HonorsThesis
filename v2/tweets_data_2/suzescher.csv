1075098865655799808,"@EdKrassen Hell Yeah! Surprised if he doesn't, I'd hope he'd consider all those grandkids.  Not that he cares at all, but the kids are innocent. He'll probably tell America to shove it, he didn't sign on for this bs, I can hear it now! He will not take accountability, he'll say WITCH HUNT!"
