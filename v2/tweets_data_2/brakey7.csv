1074624260537270273,"@Georginho1987 They have got the desire to track back. Spurs second goal admittedly was a bad pass from Mendy as we were attacking watch where Chillwell was when Ali headed it in, trotting back into his own area. And several time son left Gray and Maddison jogging behind him."
1074623375492947968,@Georginho1987 With Albrighton his problem and Gazzell is down to Puel this obsession on playing them on the opposite side so they can cut in on there strong side just doesn’t work neither of them look comfortable
1074622862592479232,"@Georginho1987 They both have two many touches on the ball instead of playing it simple and quick the time they could play some one in for a better opportunity and they take too many touches, drives menround the twist."
1074621265112154112,"@Georginho1987 Since his last Red Wes has been back to his old self, better without Maguire 🙈 am I allowed to say that"
1074620896239849472,"@Georginho1987 You’re Gray is my Maddison, flatters to deceive but looks good on the eye flicking and twisting then shit decision making"
1074620321007890433,"@lcfcawaydays_ FFS 🙄 Eddie Howe, Conte and Rogers will end up at bigger Clubs. Sam Alladyce !!!!  😫 really. Benitez is more negative and boring than Puel who every is moaning about being negative and boring. Reality check for some fans."
1074619266190712832,@Georginho1987 So true in fact some of the players become idolised for a couple of good performances and a few flicks here and there but never questioned as it’s easy to blame a manager.
1074618868230955008,@JoshCurnock Maybe just maybe the players aren’t good enough
1074618225063792640,@ajs_ajsblue1 They probably were not sure if he’d retired again or not. 🤣
