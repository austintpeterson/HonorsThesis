1074841112181919745,@PandaExpress - First time customer who ordered beef broccoli to go. Get back to work to find how many pieces of beef in my meal? Paid a lot of money for broccoli &amp; rice. Really? To make matters worse I  drove back to the store and there was no apology. Rude! https://t.co/miD4aBjiNc
