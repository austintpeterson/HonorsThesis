1069438753364692992,@KySportsRadio I guess you guys were wrong about South Warren and Franklin Simpson in the state Football games.
1069044364486344705,@KySportsRadio That's because they played middle school defense in the first half. Washington sucked the whole game.
1068342518994096128,@MikePratt22 Mike I enjoyed watching you play at UK but I must disagree with you. I'm a college hoops fan. The NBA is so unwatchable today. I have not enjoyed watching the NBA since Larry Bird retired. I haven't watched a full game in over 25 years. So boring.
1068334353514749952,I just watched the 30 for 30 on Bob Knight. It just proved what I have said for years. Knight is a bastard. He's the biggest bully that ever lived. There is a difference between making kids tougher and degrading kids like a bully. He deserves to die a very lonely man. He's a POS.
1068149262251409409,@KySportsRadio Now thats stupid.
1067284120684892161,@RoushKSR @KySportsRadio Who cares. Wilson still sucks. He takes a sack instead of throwing the ball away.
