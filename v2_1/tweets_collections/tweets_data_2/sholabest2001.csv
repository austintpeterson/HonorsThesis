1068749111673978880,@benmurraybruce I canâ€™t believe you are a senator! Ainâ€™t you supposed to be part of getting the refineries working again but because you were busy working out your hardship allowances.

1056156546311303169,@atesmustaff @Truthfully83 @dino_melaye @MBuhari @atiku Itâ€™s amazing that Nigerians donâ€™t learn as well as have limited patience. However all the complaints over the present administration has alway been there but the difference is the fight against corruption and tangible developments. Nigerian traitors will soon sing different songs
