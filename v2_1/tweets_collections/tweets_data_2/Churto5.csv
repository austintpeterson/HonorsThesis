1074084389120659457,@keeperleaguepod The Worpedo! So stoked with his FWD status. My league carries 4 x under 50 games rookies. Worp is one of them. Big lad. Will av 85ish.
1072447431978164234,@3AWisfootball She actually reports football? Thought she just digs up people’s skeletons.
1072446920159911937,"@keeperleaguepod Which defender will av the most out of: DBJ, Roberton, Webster, Crisp, Bonner. Worried about bonner/DBJ WITH Hartlett returning too.."
1072446593599750147,"@keeperleaguepod Who has the most upside of: Hall, Tyson, Prestia?"
1072395844081594368,@thedraftdoctors Ohhhh the crystal ball! Cheers boys
1072382442147852288,"@thedraftdoctors Yeah, more along the lines of the new to break out to the Uber level like Heeney and Wines. Was also thinking along the A Brayshaw, Blakey types. Did some further research and players like Bartel, M Boyd were 6/7th year. Treloar/Beams/conigs etc all 4-6th years"
1071164320149463040,@AFLFantasy any word on Mundy? Mid/forward?
1071135117437952000,"@thedraftdoctors we talk about 3rd year breakout when their av boosts from shit to good. What about when players Uber breakout and go from 95 to 110+. Danger 8th year for 110+, Ablett and Swanny 7th year for 110+. Who do you guys think will take the Uber leap this year?"
1070896433597837312,@thedraftdoctors So torn! He’s been dead wood for the last 2 years mines the end of 17. If I delist him he’ll go large I bet. Got Dom Tyson too who I have similar feelings about.
1070191490582765568,"@thedraftdoctors Lads, love the show. Top shelf. Thoughts on Prestia...? Prior to the last 2 years has gone 95+, had 2 interrupted preseasons for 85ish. Apparently flying this preseason. I’ve held him for 2 years hoping he will fulfill his potential. Can he this year?"
