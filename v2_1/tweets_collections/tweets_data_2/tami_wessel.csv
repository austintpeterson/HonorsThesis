1071830029896536065,@askjcp I bought 2 boxes of dishes at the Medford JC Penney store. 2 bowls were broken when I unloaded the boxes. I cannot find anywhere on the JC Penney website to address this problem. How can I get replacement bowls for the set? It was Pueblo Springs Durastone style #91267 16
