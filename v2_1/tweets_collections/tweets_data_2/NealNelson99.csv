1070774331507138560,"@ChrisMWilliams Somehow I’d think grabbing any western schools would cause West Virginia to evaluate their commitment to the Big XII. Would be looking for 3-5 at that point. UA, ASU, CU, UU and BYU?"
1070435446625316864,"@RobertW_01 @RachelRemarks @GeorgesNiang20 True, numbers don’t lie. However, I’ll still reference modern basketball with scores above what most middle school games are when trying to point to anything relevant to tomorrow’s contest. Can only live in the past so long..."
1070421964924350464,"@RobertW_01 @RachelRemarks @GeorgesNiang20 Iowa started the series 18-4 before peach baskets were replaced by rims, so I’d temper the talk of a big series lead in the modern era. Also, ISU leads 12-10 in the current player’s lifetime, including the aforementioned 7-3 in the last 10."
1068640057186238464,"@wundramn @TheProhmKing @hawkeyenation And is the season really over when the team is still practicing and preparing for a game? Shouldn’t a GM question that? History suggests otherwise, I guess, but a question to ask nonetheless."
1068636878134566913,"@wundramn @TheProhmKing @hawkeyenation But the season was over after the Northwestern game, correct? I mean, nothing to play for at that point. I guess I’m just stumped on how a bowl game became “meaningless” in the last couple of years. Again, totally understand the rationale on his part."
1068611172751077378,"@wundramn @TheProhmKing @hawkeyenation For the record, I understand and respect  his decision. I just don’t like that argument for it."
1068610655337529344,@wundramn @TheProhmKing @hawkeyenation But what makes the bowl game any less meaningful than the other 12 games played this season? Why play against Nebraska? That argument does nothing but diminish the overall value of bowl games. Injuries can/do happen at any time.
1067608339465539584,@Mtrubisky10 You’ve got a huge fan in western Illinois. Bear down! 🐻 https://t.co/SvlOe6gbWQ
1064896680779227136,"@MyRhythms @WideRtNattyLt Admittedly, there were some coaching decisions to be dissected (lack of timeouts to settle team/stop Arizona’s run, for starters). However, the lack of fluidity and a lot of “Hero Ball” at the end is what proved to be the downfall of the team last night. They’ll figure it out."
1047205738970599424,"@_JakeKasper_ @GottliebShow Not necessarily arguing, just saying the sample size is small and it’s apples to oranges right now. Remember, Trent Dilfer (no talent) won a Super Bowl while Dan Marino (huge talent) did not. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
