1074841208529305600,@LAFitness I feel so betrayed &amp; disappointed tonight... My (locked) locker was broken into and my North Face coat was stolen while I was working out. The worst part is that my house &amp; car keys were in one pocket. ðŸ˜£ The staff at your Royal Oak location didnâ€™t seem too concerned.
