954095527880265728,"#AskBUAmyloid Another question about SMM and AL Amy: So AL AMY can also have M spikes, light chain &amp; heavy chain issues? Since I may not SMM and only AL AMY, does that mean I would lon longer qualify (in the event of relapse) for a HRSMM trial even though that was my initial dx?"
954070113732517889,@Amyloidosis_BU One more question regarding dx. This means I no longer would qualify (in the event of relapse) for a HRSMM trial?

954003405122555904,"#AskBuAmyloid I was dx SMM in 2015 and AL Amy 2017. Amy was discovered incidentally (SAVE trial). Do I no longer have SMM? What tests determine if one has SMM, AL Amy or  both?"
