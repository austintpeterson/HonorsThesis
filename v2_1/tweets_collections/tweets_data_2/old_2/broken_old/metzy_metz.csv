1058420299333599232,@CoachBigPete @chrisacarter1 Chris has dominated and completely shut down highly recruited DE prospects in games this year. He is a complete OT with zero weaknesses. He is ready to be a 3 or 4 year starter and leader at the D1 level. He will be the steal of IL’19 OT class. Crazy that he is still available.
1055518608716128258,@chrisacarter1 He 100% dominated the highest rated DE that any DuPage Valley OT faced this season #52 OPRF. It was #52’s only bad game the past two years.

Some university is about to get themselves a dominant lineman and leader!"
