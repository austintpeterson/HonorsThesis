1074743618722775046,"@MarksReeseWIP He was a big part but I was a total team effort. Defense with turnovers and pressure, special teams got them a turnover too! I’m still not 100% on Doug’s play calling, mainly on the 3rd down prior to Elliot’s missed FG."

1072588557989150727,@MarksReeseWIP All of the above? They’re running the RPO like they still got Blount and Ajayi in the backfield. RPO worked great when a linebacker had to worry about one of those 2 running at you. can’t really fault coaches for not being able to turn crap into sugar in the secondary.

1071890992796762112,@Ike58Reese Yep....
1070767047309754368,"@Flyersguru @MarksReeseWIP True, this is a defense that lost to Mariota, Fitzpatrick, and cousins.. all of which have won nothing. Also a defense that hasn’t forced turnovers either. God I hope they win, just don’t get why he would say that publicly like that. He’s a linebacker best known for his kicking"
